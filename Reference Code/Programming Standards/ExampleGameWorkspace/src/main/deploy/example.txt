(This is the example file that th WPILib puts in /deploy.  You shouldn't need to be messing with this dir, but it's included for posterity.)

Files placed in this directory will be deployed to the RoboRIO into the
'deploy' directory in the home folder.  Use the 'frc::GetFilePath' function from 
the 'frc/FileUtilities.h' header to get a proper path relative to the deploy
directory.
